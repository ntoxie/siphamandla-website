<p><h3>A  grade 10 pupil from Siphamandla Secondary in Khayelitsha has missed almost two weeks of school because he has
 refused to cut his dreadlocks.<br>

     Sikhokhele 18 said he was told not to come back to school unless his dreadlocks were cut.<br>


    But the school says sikhokele is not suspended and has merely been asked “to comb his hair in order to look more presentable.<br><br>

     he said he couldn’t cut his hair because he followed the Rastafarian faith and Rastas believed that cutting their hair would weaken them.<br><br>

     sikhokele says he was last at school on March 13. The principal has told him about his hair before, and when I told him why I couldn’t cut my hair
      said that religion and culture was not allowed in school.

     Wilkinson said the principal’s actions had violated Diniso’s constitutional rights to dignity, freedom of religion and basic education.<br><br>

    They had asked the Western Cape Education Department to send a circular to schools giving clear guidelines on the legal position of schools 
    codes of conduct and pupils religious and cultural beliefs and practices.<br><br>

   The department’s Millicent Merton said she had spoken to the principal, who said sikhokele had not been suspended.<br><br>
    Now all learners could do whatever they want with their hair as department said so.</h3>
